# Local .deb packages placed here are automatically installed during ISO build
# 
# Usage:
#   1. Build packages: make branding-package
#   2. Copy to here: cp output/*.deb iso/live-build/config/packages.chroot/
#   3. Build ISO: make iso
#
# Packages in this directory:
#   - cortex-branding_*.deb - Branding, Plymouth, GRUB theme, wallpapers
#   - cortex-core_*.deb - Core tools (when built)
#   - etc.
#
# Note: These packages are installed via dpkg, not apt, so dependencies
# must be satisfied by packages in package-lists/*.list.chroot
